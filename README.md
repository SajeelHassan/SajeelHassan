# Hey, I'm Sajeel Hassan ðŸ‘‹

### Front End Web Developer

I'm highly motivated when it comes to learning new technologies or toolchains related to development trends. I spend most of my time learning and experimenting with anything that looks promising. Logical problem solving has always appealed to me and this explains my interest to learn modern technologies.
I would love to interact with those people who can help me grow more.
My hobbies take me to cars, aircraft, gadgets, and tech.
I actively take part in sports and extra co-curricular activities.
